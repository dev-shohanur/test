aboutCompany: Always write one. Unless a job posting specifically says not to
  send a letter of application or cover letter, you should always send one. Even
  if the company does not request a letter of application, it never hurts to
  include one. If they do ask you to send a letter, make sure to follow the
  directions exactly (for example, they might ask you to send the letter as an
  email attachment.

Use keywords. Reread the job listing, circling any keywords (such as skills or abilities that are emphasized in the listing). Try to include some of those words in your cover letter. This will help the employer see that you are a strong fit for the job.Keep it brief. Keep your letter under a page long, with no more than about four paragraphs. An employer is more likely to read a concise letter.Proofread and edit. Employers are likely to overlook an application with a lot of errors. Read through your cover letter, and if possible, ask a friend or career counselor to review the letter. Proofread for any grammar or spelling errors.
